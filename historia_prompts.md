Hi Cursor, Iâ€™m preparing a 25-minute presentation in Spanish about how to use Cursor AI to plan, manage, and execute both technical and general projects. I want to generate a Reveal.js-based slide deck using temario_inicial.md. Please help me:

1. Clone a Reveal.js starter repo
2. Create a Markdown file with slides in Spanish based on the outline temario_inicial.md
3. Use only free image sources like Unsplash (or other open APIs)
4. Embed relevant images or diagrams where helpful

Please fetch relevant images from Unsplash using keywords based on each slide topic, and embed them automatically.
```
